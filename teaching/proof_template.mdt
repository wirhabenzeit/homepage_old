````{prf:theorem} Orthogonal-Projection-Theorem
:label: my-theorem

Given $y \in \mathbb R^n$ and linear subspace $S \subset \mathbb R^n$,
there exists a unique solution to the minimization problem

```{math}
\hat y := \arg\min_{z \in S} \|y - z\|
```

The minimizer $\hat y$ is the unique vector in $\mathbb R^n$ that satisfies

* $\hat y \in S$

* $y - \hat y \perp S$


The vector $\hat y$ is called the **orthogonal projection** of $y$ onto $S$.

You can refer to a theorem using the `{prf:ref}` role like: ```{prf:ref}`my-theorem` ```, which will replace the reference with the theorem number like so: {prf:ref}`my-theorem`. When an explicit text is provided, this caption will serve as the title of the reference. For example, ```{prf:ref}`Orthogonal-Projection-Theorem <my-theorem>` ``` will produce: {prf:ref}`Orthogonal-Projection-Theorem <my-theorem>`.

An axiom directive can be included using the `prf:axiom` pattern. The directive is enumerated by default and can take in an optional title argument. The following options are also supported:

* `label` : text

	A unique identifier for your axiom that you can use to reference it with `{prf:ref}`. Cannot contain spaces or special characters.
* `class` : text

	Value of the axiomâ€™s class attribute which can be used to add custom CSS or JavaScript.
* `nonumber` : flag (empty)

	Turns off axiom auto numbering.

**Example**

```{prf:axiom} Completeness of $\mathbb{R}$
:label: my-axiom

Every Cauchy sequence on the real line is convergent.

```{prf:theorem}

This is an example of how to hide the content of a directive.
