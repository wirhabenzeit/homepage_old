# StravaMap

## What is StravaMap?

Ever wanted to see all your outdoor activities on a single _map_? With multiple map providers, the advanced filtering? Even 3D?

Or simply have a sortable and filterable list of all activities?

And maybe even some statistics? Scatter plots, timeline plots, violin plots, and more?
